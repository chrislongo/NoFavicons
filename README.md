# Info

Chrome does not have an option to block favicons (sites icons) as Firefox does.  It's also not possible to block requests for favicons from a Chrome extension.  

This extension does its best to rid the Chrome UI of the clutter of favicons.  It will replace the favicon of the site with a custom or transparent icon.  

It would be much better to block the icon request outright and remove it completely from the UI but, unfortunately, it's currently not possible from an extension.
