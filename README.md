# Info

Chrome does not have an option to block favicons (sites icons) like Firefox does.

This extension does its best to rid the Chrome UI of the clutter of favicons.  It will replace the favicon of the site with a custom or transparent icon.  

This extension first disables any links for favicons as the document loads, then replaces the site's icon with a custom one or a transparent icon for no icon.
